Previously i included tasks.py from the tmtrack project as context, but
the LLM didn't successfully detect the REST stuff from it, so I'm going to
lay it out explicitly in the background context.

<background_context>
We are making a simple, standards compliant Javascript JQuery application
that implements the user interface of a simple time tracking application
called tmtrack-ui, or Time Tracker User Interface.

The following defines the REST API schema:

Base REST API URL is /api/v1/tasks
* GET /api/v1/tasks                     - returns all tasks
* GET /api/v1/tasks/<string:task_id>    - returns task whose primary key is task_id
* PUT /api/v1/tasks/<string:task_id>    - modifies task whose primary key is task_id
* POST /api/v1/tasks                    - create a new task

The document will contain at a minimum the following attributes:

* task_id : a required string that contains a synthetic UUID created upon document creation
* userid : a required string that contains the userid of the person doing the task
* date : the required calendar date on which the task is to be done
* task_name : a required string that is the name of the task
* category : a required string that is the category of the task
* expected_hours : a required float containing the number of hours the task is expected to take
* actual_hours : an optional float containing the number of hours the task actually took
* description : an optional large string that contains text allowing the user to add some context about this task

The unique, primary key for each document is task_id.



This project should be made as simply as possible given the requirements,
with a minimum of extras.
This project's code, design and layout must be focused on newcomers to
Javascript and JQuery.

The web app should have a the following features:

    * The left side of the screen should contain a clickable list of 
      available days (some standard month, day, year format) as fetched with
      the REST API.  These should be sorted with the most recent day first.
    * There should be a button on the top left, above the dates, that will
      create a new day, which will trigger POST REST API.
    * When one of the days is clicked, the clicked day on the left should be
      highlighted.
    * All of the data in the clicked day should be reproduced in the main
      panel of the app, covering most of the right side of the screen.
    * All of the field values should be editable.
    * There should be a button on the right side of the screen that saves
      modifications back through the REST API.
    * Newly created days, as describe previously, should bring up the same
      basic web form on the right side of the screen, as described above.

The styling, font and other user interface elements should be simple, clean,
straightforward and modern.

The REST API should be assumed to be running on http://localhost:5000/ with
endpoints described in the attached file.  Do not use any mock libraries for
testing or any other purpose.  Always use the real REST API found at 
http://localhost:5000/

</background_context>


<create_project>
Please create this project as defined above, including all of the necessary
directory structure, configuration and support files.

This project will be developed, tested and deployed on Ubuntu Linux version 24.

This project will be hosted on github, please include all standard support and 
documentation files appropriate for a new github, javascript JQuery
project.

Please describe in extreme detail all of the steps required for all stages of
the project development, testing and simple production deployment using the
Ubuntu command line.  This has to include project initiation steps, testing
steps, iteration steps, and deployment steps.

Please provide the necessary fixes for these errors.
</fix-initial-runtime-errors>


<fix-initial-runtime-errors-v2> # depreciated
The application is using the URL /tasks for the REST API which is incorrect.  The correct REST API URL is /api/v1/tasks
Please re-write the application to accurately reflect this.
</fix-initial-runtime-errors-v2>


<fix-jquery-tasks-sort>

Upon page load, the following error occurs:

Uncaught TypeError: tasks.sort is not a function

Please update the application to resolve this error.

<add-debugging-to-see-errors>
Please modify the app to display all headers and diagnostics when any REST
call does not return successfully.
</add-debugging-to-see-errors>


<make-error-selectable>
When an REST call fails, I see an error popup, but I am unable to select
any of the text with my mouse.  Please modify the application so that I can
select the text of the popup with my mouse.

<fix-float-int-error>
When clicking the New Day button, the following error is reported: 

Error Context: Failed to save the task.

Status Code: 400 (BAD REQUEST)
Text Status: error
Error Thrown: BAD REQUEST

--- Response Headers ---
content-length: 200
content-type: application/json

--- Response Body ---
{"errors":{"actual_hours":"'actual_hours' must be of type float, but got int.","expected_hours":"'expected_hours' must be of type float, but got int."},"message":"Validation failed","status":"error"}

Please modify the application to resolve this error.

</fix-float-int-error>


<fix-float-int-error-2>
When clicking the New Day button, the following error is reported:

Error Context: Failed to save the task.

Status Code: 400 (BAD REQUEST)
Text Status: error
Error Thrown: BAD REQUEST

--- Response Headers ---
content-length: 200
content-type: application/json

--- Response Body ---
{"errors":{"actual_hours":"'actual_hours' must be of type float, but got int.","expected_hours":"'expected_hours' must be of type float, but got int."},"message":"Validation failed","status":"error"}

Your last updates did not fix this.  Please modify the application to resolve this error.
</fix-float-int-error-2>

We are now successfully saving new tasks.

<fix-undefined-days>
The requested list of days on the left side of the app show as 'undefined'.  Further, it always shows
two days as 'undefined' no matter how many tasks are returned.  Please modify the application to
resolve this problem.
</fix-undefined-days>
We are now displaying dates correctly.

<fix-dates-not-populating>
When I click on one of the dates on the left side, the REST GET successfully fetches the
correct task, but the app does not populate the web form as requested.

Please modify the application to resolve this problem.

</fix-dates-not-populating>

And this now works.

<fix-number-validation-bug>
When I entered expected hours as 2.75 there was a popup error:

Please enter a valid value. The two nearest valid values are 2.7 and 2.8.

Please modify the application to resolve this problem.
