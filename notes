Previously i included tasks.py from the tmtrack project as context, but
the LLM didn't successfully detect the REST stuff from it, so I'm going to
lay it out explicitly in the background context.

<background_context>
We are making a simple, standards compliant Javascript JQuery application
that implements the user interface of a simple time tracking application
called tmtrack-ui, or Time Tracker User Interface.

The following defines the REST API schema:

Base REST API URL is /api/v1/tasks
* GET /api/v1/tasks                     - returns all tasks
* GET /api/v1/tasks/<string:task_id>    - returns task whose primary key is task_id
* PUT /api/v1/tasks/<string:task_id>    - modifies task whose primary key is task_id
* POST /api/v1/tasks                    - create a new task

The document will contain at a minimum the following attributes:

* task_id : a required string that contains a synthetic UUID created upon
            document creation
* userid : a required string that contains the userid of the person doing the
           task
* date : the required calendar date on which the task is to be done
* task_name : a required string that is the name of the task
* category : a required string that is the category of the task
* expected_hours : a required float containing the number of hours the task
                   is expected to take
* actual_hours : an optional float containing the number of hours the task
                 actually took
* description : an optional large string that contains text allowing the user
                to add some context about this task

The unique, primary key for each document is task_id.



This project should be made as simply as possible given the requirements,
with a minimum of extras.
This project's code, design and layout must be focused on newcomers to
Javascript and JQuery.

The web app should have a the following features:

    * The left side of the screen should contain a clickable list of 
      available days (some standard month, day, year format) as fetched with
      the REST API.  These should be sorted with the most recent day first.
    * There should be a button on the top left, above the dates, that will
      create a new day, which will trigger POST REST API.
    * When one of the days is clicked, the clicked day on the left should be
      highlighted.
    * All of the data in the clicked day should be reproduced in the main
      panel of the app, covering most of the right side of the screen.
    * All of the field values should be editable.
    * There should be a button on the right side of the screen that saves
      modifications back through the REST API.
    * Newly created days, as describe previously, should bring up the same
      basic web form on the right side of the screen, as described above.

The styling, font and other user interface elements should be simple, clean,
straightforward and modern.

The REST API should be assumed to be running on http://localhost:5000/ with
endpoints described in the attached file.  Do not use any mock libraries for
testing or any other purpose.  Always use the real REST API found at 
http://localhost:5000/

</background_context>


<create_project>
Please create this project as defined above, including all of the necessary
directory structure, configuration and support files.

This project will be developed, tested and deployed on Ubuntu Linux version 24.

This project will be hosted on github, please include all standard support and 
documentation files appropriate for a new github, javascript JQuery
project.

Please describe in extreme detail all of the steps required for all stages of
the project development, testing and simple production deployment using the
Ubuntu command line.  This has to include project initiation steps, testing
steps, iteration steps, and deployment steps.

<fix-initial-runtime-errors-v2> # depreciated
The application is using the URL /tasks for the REST API which is incorrect.  The correct REST API URL is /api/v1/tasks
Please re-write the application to accurately reflect this.

<fix-float-int-error>
When clicking the New Day button, the following error is reported: 

Error Context: Failed to save the task.

Status Code: 400 (BAD REQUEST)
Text Status: error
Error Thrown: BAD REQUEST

--- Response Headers ---

Please modify the application to resolve this error.

</fix-float-int-error>


<fix-float-int-error-2>
When clicking the New Day button, the following error is reported:

Error Context: Failed to save the task.

Status Code: 400 (BAD REQUEST)
Text Status: error
Error Thrown: BAD REQUEST

--- Response Headers ---
content-length: 200

--- Response Body ---
{"errors":{"actual_hours":"'actual_hours' must be of type float, but got int.","expected_hours":"'expected_hours' must be of type float, but got int."},"message":"Validation failed","status":"error"}

Your last updates did not fix this.  Please modify the application to resolve this error.
</fix-float-int-error-2>

We are now successfully saving new tasks.

<fix-undefined-days>
The requested list of days on the left side of the app show as 'undefined'.  Further, it always shows
two days as 'undefined' no matter how many tasks are returned.  Please modify the application to
resolve this problem.
</fix-undefined-days>
We are now displaying dates correctly.

<fix-dates-not-populating>
When I click on one of the dates on the left side, the REST GET successfully fetches the
correct task, but the app does not populate the web form as requested.

Please modify the application to resolve this problem.

</fix-dates-not-populating>

And this now works.

<fix-number-validation-bug>
When I entered expected hours as 2.75 there was a popup error:

Please enter a valid value. The two nearest valid values are 2.7 and 2.8.

Please modify the application to resolve this problem.
</fix-number-validation-bug>

Fixed.

<make-new-day-default-to-todays-date>
Please change the application such that when New Day is clicked, the
date in the main form defaults to today's date.

</make-new-day-default-to-todays-date>

Works great.


But I really need to re-think the entire UI flow.

NOTE RUNNING:
$ python3 -m http.server 8000
# in tmtrack:
$ flask run

http://127.0.0.1:8000/


Fri 26 Sep 08:04:42 PDT 2025
Thinking more about the fundamental flow of the application.

The edit pane should be day focused, not task focused.  When a day is
selected, all of the tasks for that day for that userid, if any, should be
displayed and made editable all at the same time.

Adding a new task for a day should be as simple as clicking an add button
in the editing pane a new, empty entry shows up.

So we should organize our entries horizontally I think, one 'line' per task.

The current date should be displayed prominently on the edit pane.

task_category(dropdown), task_name(single edit line), expected_hours(small float box), actual_hours(small float box), description(single edit line)

When we land on the app, it should display the oldest day that has any
task without an actual_hours attribute set.  Putting something in actual_hours
is how we say the task is dispositioned.

All of the days that have undispositioned tasks should be highlighted on the
left side.

If we click on new day, and there are no tasks with today's date, then
an edit form with today's date comes up with a blank task.  If we click on
new day and there are tasks for today's date, then we produce a popup date
picker and let the user pick a future date.  Only days that have no tasks can
be picked.  Once picked, same as above with the edit window showing a single
blank task.

Everywhere we see a date, we should also see a three letter day of the week 
with it.

<add-global-userid>
Above the New Day button, please add a the text "UserId" with a narrow 
textbox immediate to its right.  Both the text and the textbox should
remain above centered above the New Day button.

This textbox should be called userid.

Please modify the application appropriately.
</add-global-userid>

Worked, but it named the userid box "userid_filter", because there's
already a 'userid' in the form.

<rename-global-userid>
Please change the name and id of the userid text box to just "userid".

</rename-global-userid>

Fixed it.

<change-edit-pane-to-multi-tasks>
The main panel of the app, also known as the edit pane, should display
all of the tasks for the selected day.

Please replace the current form that only shows a single task with 
a list of all of the tasks for the selected day.  Each task in the list
should be displayed in a single line.  Each line should have the
following elements, which shall be called task_line, displayed from left
to right:
    * category - a required narrow width text box
    * task_name - a required medium width text box
    * expected_hours - a required number input box that accepts a floating
      point number
    * actual_hours - an optional number input box that accepts a floating
      point number
    * description - an optional medium width single line text box
    * save - a button that when clicked writes the current task_line back
      to the REST API

The existing form_userid textshould should not be displayed, and the 
userid attribute we added at the top should be used for all of the tasks
written back to the REST API.

Each input box for each task_line should have to the left of it then name of
the input box, and the entire line sbould be displayed in a somewhat compressed
format

On the top left of the edit pane add a button called "Add Task".  When clicked,
this button should add a new task_line to the edit pane, below the existing
lines.  This new line should be designed the same as the existing task lines.

All of the fields described above, category, task_name, expected_hours,
actual_hours, description should always be editable.

When the save button is clicked for a given task_line, successful validation
should be done for the fields in that task line prior to the task being
written back to the REST API.  Any validation errors should be provided in
an easy to see popup box that allows the text of the validation error to be
selected by the mouse.

Please modify the application to meet these criteria.
</change-edit-pane-to-multi-tasks>

<multi-users-pt1>
We need to add very basic multi user support.  There is a new REST API
whose route is /api/v1/users that returns this data structure:
 {
    "users" : [
       "userid1",
       "userid2"
    ]
 }

Please fetch these userids on startup and save them is an appropriately named
variable.

Also change the UserId text box on the top left to a drop down whose entries
are populated by the userids returned from /api/v1/users

The selected userid should be used in the saved tasks as before.

Please modify the application to reflect these changes.
</multi-users-pt1>

<multi-users-pt2>
Change the list of dates on the left side to only include dates that have
tasks for the currently selected userid.
Change the list of tasks for a given date in the edit pane to only include
tasks for the currently selected date and also for the currently
selected userid.  To be clear: we should only see dates and tasks related
to the selected userid.

These two changes imply that if no userid is selected, no dates or tasks
should be displayed.  As soon as a userid is selected, on click of the
drop down, the dates that contain tasks for the selected userid should
immediately be populated on the left, and the oldest date that has any
tasks without a defined actual_hours value should have all of its tasks
populated in the edit pane as before.
</multi-users-pt2>

<categories-editor>
There is a new REST route called categories.  A GET on the categories route
will return something like this:
 {
     "categories" : [
         "category1",
         "category2"
     ]
 }

In the same way, a PUT on the categories route will replace the entire,
single document with the value in the PUT request.  The PUT request will
have exactly the same document format as described above.

Please add a new button called 'Categories' between the New Day button
and the UserId dropdown.  When clicked, this Categories button will
produce a large modal box called 'Categories Editor' that has a list
of all of the categories supplied by the REST categories route defined
above.  The list of categories in Categories Editor will be editable.
Users should be able to add new categories, remove categories and
re-order categories.  At the bottom of Categories Editor will be
two buttons.  The first is 'Save' which will cause the current
list of categories in Categories Editor to be written back to the
REST API by the above describe PUT route and then cause the box to
disappear.  The second button is 'Cancel' which will cause the box to
disappear without writing any changes back.
</categories-editor>

The results are impressive.  It did exactly as requested but it also
implemented the next feature which I was going to ask for next.
It changed the category field of the task lines in the edit pane
to drop downs that match the values in the Categories Editor.

<highlight-unsaved-tasks>
In the edit pane, as tasks are added or edited, the line associated
with the newly added or edited task should be highlighted until it
is saved.  As soon as the task is saved to the REST API by clicking
the existing Save button, reverse the highlight of that line so
that it looks as it did before it was edited.
</highlight-unsaved-tasks>

<highlight-incomplete-days>
Each day on the left side that has any tasks with the actual_hours
attribute unset should be highlighted in a different way than the
currently selected day is highlighted.

Continue highlighting the currently edited day but also add a
different, subtle highlight to any of the other days that have
any tasks that don't have actual_hours set.
</highlight-incomplete-days>

<minimal-successful-task-save>
When a task is saved, instead of a popup box that says
"Task saved successfully!" that requires a mouse click of the OK
button, show some kind of brief message on the bottom of the screen
that requires no user intervention.  The message will not interfere
with any other clicks or actions, and disappear after a few seconds.
</minimal-successful-task-save>

<gemini-resync>
Please fully display all of the current code for this project as it
is at this time.
</gemini-resync>

<dates-have-days>
To the displayed dates on the left, to each add a three letter day of
the week at the end.  So "2025-09-24" should be displayed as
"2025-09-24 Wed" because September 24th, 2025 was a Wednesday.
The three letter day of the week should accurately reflect what day
of the week that day was.  Make no other changes to the app.
</dates-have-days>
